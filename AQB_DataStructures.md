### Task

Write a **pseudocode solution** to report the **sum of all `Bond_Value`**, for all portfolio IDs that meet **both** of the following conditions:

1. The same `Bond_Ratings` appears in **more than one** portfolio.
2. The combination of (`No_of_holdings`, `No_UnqSec`) is **unique**, i.e., no other portfolio has the same pair.

> Note: Round each `Bond_Value` to **two decimal places** before summing.
